This is some a short explanation about the tools that i've using it during working this project.

For the frontend, i choose an one of minimalistic and powerful javascript's framework called vue.
why i'm using it? Because for me as an front end web developer, this languange it's so beautiful
that everytime i need recompile every update it just take any seconds without some delay.

the rest of it, i'm following the rules of the test, such as i'm using tailwind and also completely
setup it on laravel webpack

therefore once again, to whoever inspecting this test.
i'm simply humbly to thank you enough for giving me this wonderful opportunity

Sincere 
Your Humble Candidate Developer :)
